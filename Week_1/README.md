# Week 1

In this week, we shall be focusing upon Computer Representation of Mathematical Objects. The content to be covered is given below. Though we will eventually focus on the implementation, a lot of math is going to be involved in this SoC. So, it is highly encouraged for you to ask doubts on the whatsapp group :) 

## Reading 

1. Chapter 1, 2 of [Elements of Combinatorial Computing by Wells](../Elements_of_Combinatorial_Computing.pdf) (optional, as this describes the definitions of terms we use in everyday programming. Not really necessary, but you can check it out if interested)
2. Chapter 3 of [Elements of Combinatorial Computing by Wells](../Elements_of_Combinatorial_Computing.pdf). (this is really what we are interested in :))

Further reading and assignments will be updated soon.
