# Week 1

In this week, we shall be focusing upon Computer Representation of Mathematical Objects. The content to be covered is given below. Though we will evventually focus on the implementation, a lot of math is going to be involved in this SoC. So, it is highly encouraged for you to ask doubts :) 

## Reading 

1. Chapter 3 of [Elements of Combinatorial Computing by Wells](../Elements_of_Combinatorial_Computing.pdf).

Further reading and assignments will be updated soon.
