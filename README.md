# Combinatorial Computing

This is the repository for the project *Combinatorial Computing*. The reference books we will be using for this project can be found [here](Reference_books)

The tentative timeline of this project is : 
* Week 1 : Computer Representation of Mathematical Objects
* Week 2 : Backtrack Programming, enumeration by exhaustive search
* Week 3 : Satisfiability and SAT Solvers
* Week 4 : Generation of Elementary Configurations, permutations, partitions and sets
* Week 5 : Misc. algorithmic techniques, graph algorithms
* Week 6 : Elementary Number theoretic algorithms
* Week 7 : Latin squares, four color problem, other advanced combinatorial problems
* Week 8 : Parker square generation, final presentation
