# Week 2

In this week, we shall be focusing upon Backtrack Programming, enumeration by exhaustive search. The content to be covered is given below. Though we will eventually focus on the implementation, a lot of math is going to be involved in this SoC. So, it is highly encouraged for you to ask doubts on the whatsapp group :)

## Reading

### Basic discrete structures

Those unfamiliar with basic discrete structures (mainly graphs), can refer the following resources. 

1. Some basic [graph theory terminology](https://www.dmg.tuwien.ac.at/gittenberger/Folien/GrTh_Basics.pdf).

2. [Latin squares](http://web.math.ucsb.edu/~padraic/ucsb_2014_15/math_116_s2015/math_116_s2015_lecture6.pdf) and theorems based on filling of partial latin squares.

### Complexity theory

You might have heard of an algorithm being "efficient". But what does it mean for an algorithm to be efficient? 
Talking about the time complexity of problems is the bread and butter of computer scientists. Apart from this, you might have heard about the famous $P = NP$ problem. What does it mean for the problem to be in P, or NP, and why should you care?

1. A lecture based upon [basic introduction to time complexity of algorithms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWg7U0OEAoE&list=PLBF3763AF2E1C572F) which uses sorting algorithms for illustration.

2. CS218 lecture slides by prof. Rohit Gurjar explaining [P, NP, NP Completeness](./NPcompleteness.pdf) problems.

### Search and enumeration

1. Chapter 4 of [Elements of Combinatorial Computing by Wells](../Reference_books/Elements_of_Combinatorial_Computing.pdf).

## Problems

1. Here is a very nice [problem](./graph_game_q1.pdf) based on a 2-player game on graphs based upon dynamic programming which was a part of CS218.
