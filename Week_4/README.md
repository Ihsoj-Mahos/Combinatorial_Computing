# Week 4

In this week, we shall be focusing upon Generation of elementary configurations. The content to be covered is given below. Though we will eventually focus on the implementation, a lot of math is going to be involved in this SoC. So, it is highly encouraged for you to ask doubts on the whatsapp group :)

## Reading

In this week, we will cover generation of elementary configurations, partitions, sets, permutations and some random discrete math stuff. 

1. Posets and lattices are interesting mathematical objects, since they occur quite frequently in computer science and have interesting properties. [This](Posets.pdf) handout covers the basic properties of posets, defines lattices. Moreover, whenever posets arise, dilworth's theorem and mirsky's theorem seem to be useful. [This](https://math.ucdenver.edu/~wcherowi/courses/m7409/acln10.pdf) handout covers them along with hall's matching theorem and many others. Often you have many theorems that are equivalent or one derives others. The handout covers the relationship between various such theorems as well.

2. Equivalence relations also occur quite frequently in problems, and are also interesting to study. [This](EquivalenceRelations.pdf) handout defines them and gives some examples. [This](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~ggbaker/zju/math/equiv-rel.html) is another source which relates equivalence relations and partitions.

3. Read chapter 5 from [Elements of Combinatorial Computing](../Reference_books/Elements_of_Combinatorial_Computing.pdf) by Wells.

## Problems

### Theory

1. [This](equivalence_exercise.pdf) is an exercise sheet based upon equivalence relations, and [this](posets_exercise.pdf) exercise covers posets. They may require other theorems such as induction, recurrences, etc. If any terms feel unfamiliar, feel free to ask.
