# Week 5

In this week, we shall be focusing upon miscellaneous algorithmic methods. We'll cover some basic methods as well as some stuff related to matchings. The content to be covered is given below.

## Reading 

This section of the project is closely related to design and analysis of algorithms (CS218) offered by the CSE Department. So, we will be using some content directly from this course

1. Read chapter 6 from [Elements of Combinatorial Computing](../Reference_books/Elements_of_Combinatorial_Computing.pdf) by Wells.

2. Some reading about greedy algorithms and dynamic programming from CS218 [slides](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~rgurjar/CS218_2023/slides/GreedyDPSlides.pdf) by Prof. Rohit Gurjar.
